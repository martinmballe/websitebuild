A little about me XD
I just wanted to give you a little insight into who's behind all of this code. When I'm not coding, I love hanging out with friends and doing fun stuff like hiking and playing board games. In the weekends, I love to just relax and watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I love Chandler ‚ù§Ô∏è He's my favorite, he's so funny, like when he goes "Could I be any more...", you know just typical Chandler-stuff haha! And oh, Ugly Naked Guy, what a legend! "Eww, Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles," haha, classic!
But let's talk about those funny scenes. Remember when Ross was trying to move his couch and he yelled "Pivot! Pivot!" until his voice cracked? That gets me every time! And don't even get me started on the episode where Joey puts on all of Chandler's clothes! "Could I BE wearing any more clothes?" Hilarious!
But amidst all the laughs, there are those heartwarming moments too. Like when Ross bought Phoebe a bike because she never learned how to ride one. I'll admit, I teared up a bit! üòÇ It was so wholesome, seeing them support each other like that. And let's not forget about the time Chandler and Monica got engaged, or when they brought home the twins! Ah, the feels!
So yeah, that's a little glimpse into what makes me tick when I'm not busy coding away. Friends, laughs, and a whole lot of Chandler moments. Can it BE any more perfect? üòÑ
